                  DataRight+: Bulk Transaction Detail
    draft-authors-datarightplus-banking-bulk-transactions-v1-latest

Abstract

   This specification outlines the DataRight+ extension functionality
   for an asynchronous bulk banking transaction detail capability within
   the existing constructs of the profile described in [PROFILE-AU-CDR].

   The functionality exposed by the Provider allows the Initiator to
   request, using the same filter parameters of the [CDS] List Banking
   Transactions, a full set of Banking Transaction Detail via a job
   queue, poll and retrieval mechanism.

1.  Scope

   The scope of this specification is focused on describing an
   asynchronous capability for downloading bulk banking transactions
   from a specific Provider supplied resource server.  This
   specification does not seek to provide further definition as this is
   left to what is specified in [PROFILE-AU-CDR].

2.  Terms & Definitions

   This specification uses the terms "Provider" and "Initiator" as
   defined by [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA].

3.  High Level Process

   This document, as extended further in OpenAPI format within
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-REDOCLY-ID2], describes the endpoints to deliver the
   Bulk Banking Transaction Detail capability.  An identified challenge
   faced by participants within the Australian CDR is a desire of
   Initiators to obtain Banking Transaction Details for all transactions
   while balancing the performance constraints of Providers.  On the one
   hand Initiators are often needing to iterate over lists of
   transactions to obtain, on an individual basis, transaction details,
   sometimes hitting the upper bounds of the prescribed Non-Functional
   Requirements while on the other hand Providers often must interact
   with many different sources of data to provide all the attributes
   contained within the BankingTransactionDetailV1 schema.

   At a high level the process expected to be followed through the
   implementation of the prescribed endpoints is as follows:

   1.  Initiator obtains a Consumer approved token, containing the
       bank:transaction:read and bank:accounts.basic:read scopes from
       the Provider through normal processes as prescribed within
       [PROFILE-AU-CDR], [CDS] and [CDR-RULES];
   2.  Initiator obtains a list of banking accounts, using the
       listBankingAccounts operation, as described in
       [DATARIGHTPLUS-REDOCLY-ID2].  Further elaboration regarding this
       endpoint is outside the scope of this document;
   3.  Initiator lodges a requestBankingTransactionDetailList request,
       including account identifier and desired filters, from the
       Provider Resource Server;
   4.  The Provider responds with metadata including the Action
       Identifier to be used to address the action by the Initiator;
   5.  Periodically the Initiator polls the Provider Resource Server
       using the getBankingTransactionDetailListStatus operation until
       the status returned indicates readiness;
   6.  When the Provider indicates readiness, Initiator calls the
       retrieveBankingTransactionDetailList, the Provider responds with
       a continuous list of BankingTransactionDetailV1 objects;

4.  Provider Resource Server Endpoints

   The Provider SHALL make available, as described further in the
   following subsections and specified in OpenAPI format within
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-REDOCLY-ID2], the following endpoints where the token
   is granted the bank:transactions:read scope value:

   Note: Each endpoint supports a number of other error behaviours,
   these are documented within [DATARIGHTPLUS-REDOCLY-ID2] and are
   intended to align with the behaviours described within [CDS].

5.  Key Schema Definitions

   Key schemas utilised for achieving the defined scope are described as
   follows.

5.1.  Request Banking Transaction Detail List

   Defined within [DATARIGHTPLUS-REDOCLY-ID2] as
   RequestBankingTransactionDetailListDataV1 this schema is used to
   provide the request information, is replayed by the Get Banking
   Transaction Detail List Status endpoint, and is intended to be a
   like-for-like to the input parameters for List Transactions for
   Banking Account as outlined within [CDS].
